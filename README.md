To get started with this project make sure to run your sql program of choice, in this case I used pgadmin4.

After cloning the files for the project, you can copy paste the "Table_Creation_Code.sql" located in the Diagram Draft folder into your query tool and run it to create the tables needed for this assignment.

After creating the tables, use the sql program's import function to import the data from 6 CSVs located in the data folder into the corresponding tables.

Finally in order to run the queries you can choose to use the compiled code document I created or you can choose to copy paste the code from each of the individual questions into your query tool and run them.

For this challenge we were tasked with:

1. Creating an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables for employees of a fictional company (Data Modeling).
2. This included creating tables for 6 CSV files, and assigning the proper data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints (Data Engineering).
3. Finally we needed to create queries that answered the following questions (Data Analysis):
    List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

    List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

    List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

    List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

    List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

    List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

    List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

    List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
